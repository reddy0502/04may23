    "A time series is a series of data points indexed or ordered by time intervals. In simpler terms, it's a sequence of observations taken at successive points in time. Time series data is commonly collected at regular intervals (e.g., hourly, daily, monthly) and is used to understand patterns, trends, and behaviors that evolve over time."

    "For forecasting future sales based on the monthly sales data for the past three years, I would recommend using a Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model. The reason for this recommendation is that the data exhibits seasonality (i.e., repeating patterns) over time, and SARIMA is specifically designed to handle such seasonality in time series data.\n",
    "\n",
    "SARIMA combines the concepts of ARIMA with an additional seasonal component to account for the repeating patterns observed in seasonal data. It is an extension of the standard ARIMA model that takes into account both the autoregressive and moving average components, as well as the seasonal differences and autocorrelation.\n",

    "Here are the key reasons why a SARIMA model would be suitable for forecasting future sales in this scenario:\n",

    "Seasonality: The monthly sales data for a retail store is likely to exhibit seasonal patterns, such as increased sales during holiday seasons or specific months of the year. SARIMA can effectively capture and model these seasonal effects.\n",

    "Autocorrelation: SARIMA can handle autocorrelation in the data, meaning the relationship between the current sales and its past sales at different lags. Autocorrelation is often observed in time series data, and SARIMA can incorporate this information into the forecasting process.\n",
